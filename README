About
-----
'ipager' is a simple pager.



Installation
------------
To install / compile 'ipager' you need 'scons':

* link:http://www.scons.org

It's a clever buildsystem which i prefer over make/autotools. Be sure you
grab the latest (0.96.90) version installed to avoid problems at install-time.
After installing 'scons' you just type:

    $> scons

and it should build your personal version of 'ipager'.
You can influence the build-process by some variables, check

    $> scons -h

To install it finally to your system use:

    $> scons install

and thats it.


Usage
-----
After a very first launch IPager creates a default config 
file $HOME/.ipager/ipager.conf
You can define other config file via '-c' command line option.


    $> ipager
    $> ipager -c /path/to/config/file/other.config


Some additional themes (config files) you may find in the 'themes' directory
of its distrib.
